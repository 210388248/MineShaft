# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the maintainers of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request Process
Only pull request based on a issue will be accepted, any new feature, bug fix and other change
must have a corresponding issue created first.

Any class, method, function and module starts with `docstring` descripting the functionality of
the block of code about to be created (why we need it, what does it do, how do we use it). The
`docstring` defines the code to be written, before the code is writen allowing others to review
and contribute to the same code block if capable.

Document about the application programming interface of the function or class should be ready
before the pull request is submitted.

Maintainers of the repository shall review the pull request before approving the merge.
